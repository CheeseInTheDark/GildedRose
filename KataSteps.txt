Kata steps:

Created test to make the InventorySystem in GildedRoseTest and put the items array in it
Created test to drive in updating of the Inventory in InventorySystem
Created test to drive in update calls to StoreItems in Inventory
Created test to drive in creation of StoreItems from Items in InventoryFactory and drive in StoreItemFactory
Created test to drive in creation of a StoreItem from an Item in StoreItemFactory
Created test to drive in creation of a ConjuredItem from an Item in StoreItemFactory
Created test to drive in storage of an item in StoreItem
Created test to drive in update behavior
	*Created StoreItem test to require change to update method in ConjuredItem
Created test to drive in sellIn behavior
Created integration test at InventorySystem level
	*This should have been the second test written

Points of concern:
-Use PowerMock
-Some state-based testing in ConjuredItem
-There is a weak but present argument that the solution can be called a rewrite

Strengths:
-Focuses directly on the new requirement
-Works alongside legacy implementation rather than destroying it
-Cleanliness of new code is high
-Inventory system is easily extensible to new item types
